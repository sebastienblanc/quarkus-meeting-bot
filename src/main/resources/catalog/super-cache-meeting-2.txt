Transcript of meeting#2 about "Super cache" feature : 

Philippe: "Team, urgent update. We've encountered a last-minute bug on the pre-prod environment related to the 'Super Cache' feature. We need to address this before proceeding with the deployment. Let's jump into a crisis meeting. Mary, can you provide more details on the issue?"

Mary: "Certainly, Philippe. It seems there's an unexpected conflict with the existing caching mechanism, causing intermittent errors for some users. Karim, I believe this might be related to the recent backend optimizations."

Karim: "I'll take a look at the code right away to identify the root cause. My apologies if the optimizations inadvertently triggered this issue. I'll get to the bottom of it."

Philippe: "No worries, Karim. Let's prioritize finding a solution. Betty, any impact on the testing you conducted earlier?"

Betty: "The bug didn't surface during the initial testing, but I'll re-run the test suite to confirm the extent of the problem. We need to ensure that we catch any potential side effects on user interactions."

Mary: "While Karim and Betty investigate, let's discuss a contingency plan. Philippe, do we have the option to postpone the deployment, or is there a critical deadline we're working against?"

Philippe: "Our priority is a smooth rollout, so if we need to delay to ensure stability, we'll do so. Let's get a clear picture from Karim and Betty first. Karim, any initial findings on the code conflict?"

Karim: "I've identified the issue, and it's related to the way the new caching mechanism interacts with a specific module. I'm working on a fix now."

Philippe: "Great, Karim. Keep us posted on your progress. Betty, any insights from the re-run of the test suite?"

Betty: "The tests are revealing the same intermittent errors. It looks like it's isolated to a specific user scenario. I'll document the test cases and share them with Karim for targeted debugging."

Philippe: "Understood. Let's aim for a quick resolution, but quality is our top priority. Team, any additional thoughts or suggestions?"

Mary: "While we work on the fix, let's communicate transparently with the rest of the team and set their expectations. We don't want surprises during the deployment."

Betty: "Agreed. I'll draft a message to the team outlining the situation and potential delay. Open communication is key."

Philippe: "Thanks, Mary and Betty. Karim, how are we looking on the fix?"

Karim: "I've implemented a workaround for now, but I'll need more time for a permanent solution. The deployment can proceed, but we should plan for a post-launch patch to fully resolve the issue."

Philippe: "Okay, let's proceed with the workaround for now and schedule a post-launch patch. Communicate this to the team, Betty. We'll regroup after the deployment for a thorough post-mortem and to finalize the permanent fix. Thank you, everyone, for your swift response to this unexpected challenge."
